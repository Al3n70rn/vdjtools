## VDJtools

A comprehensive framework for post-analysis of immune repertoire sequencing data.
Compiled binaries are available from [here](https://github.com/mikessh/vdjtools/releases/latest).
The software is cross-platform and requires Java v1.8 to run and R to perform plotting.

Easy installation on **MacOS/Linux** via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) or [Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh/):
```bash
brew tap mikessh/repseq
brew install vdjtools
vdjtools CalcBasicStats ...
```

For **Windows** just use the latest VDJtools bundle marked with ``.win.zip`` suffix.

List of features and detailed documentation can be found at [ReadTheDocs](http://vdjtools-doc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

Example datasets and shell scripts are provided in a separate [repository](https://github.com/mikessh/vdjtools-examples).
