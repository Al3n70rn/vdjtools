# VDJtools

A comprehensive framework for post-analysis of immune repertoire sequencing data.
Compiled binaries are available from [here](https://github.com/mikessh/vdjtools/releases/latest).
The software is cross-platform and requires Java v1.8 (it can still be compiled from source under 
JRE 1.7 though) to run and R to generate publication-ready graphics.

List of features and detailed documentation can be found at [ReadTheDocs](http://vdjtools-doc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

Example datasets and shell scripts are provided in a separate [repository](https://github.com/mikessh/vdjtools-examples).
